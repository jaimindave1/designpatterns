Design Principles :-

0. Identify the aspects that vary and encapsulate them from what stays same.
1. Program to interface, not to implementation
2. Favor composition over inheritance
3. Strive for loosely coupled desings between objects that intract.
 
Design Patterns:-
0) Strategy Pattern  (Indexing starts with zer ;-))
	-The strategy pattern defines family of algorithms, encapsulate them and make them interchangable. Strategy let them vary independently from client that use it.
1) Observer Pattern
	-Observer pattern defines one to many dependency between objects, so that when one object changes state,other dependent objects gets notified and updated automatically.
